## Overview

Welcome to the Greenhouse Monitoring Application! I created this app out of necessityâ€”I couldnâ€™t find a suitable tool to monitor my greenhouse project, so I built my own. This app lets you keep an eye on important environmental factors like soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and light intensity using sensors. Plus, it includes a section for real-time weather updates to help you manage your greenhouse more effectively.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Easily track soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and light intensity.
- **Weather Updates**: Get real-time weather information with integrated APIs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for easy navigation and clear data visualization.

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
3. Add your API keys in the configuration file.
4. Build and run the application.

## How to Use
